A reader recently asked me what jumper numbers haven’t been used yet, which is a relatively simple question compared to some of the other ones I have looked at in the past.

As far as I am aware AFL players are not allowed to wear the number 0, like they do in basketball. Zero aside, every number between 1 and 60 has been worn at least once, with 63, 65, and 67 also being worn.

Some “famous” names associated with uncommon jumper numbers:
- #49: James Hird
- #52: Robert Harvey
- #57: Alastair Clarkson
- #60: Tony Liberatore
- #63: Mark Perkins
- #65: Andrew Witts
- #67: Lance Franklin, Shane Edwards (along with other players as part of [Sir Doug Nicholls Indigenous Round in 2017](https://www.afl.com.au/news/90302/players-number-tribute-to-indigenous-breakthrough#:~:text=laws%20for%20them.-,No.,Dreamtime%20at%20the%20'G%20match.))
