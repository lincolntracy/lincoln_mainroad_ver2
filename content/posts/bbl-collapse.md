*An innings can turn on its head very quickly*

<!--more-->

It’s just ticked past the first anniversary of the Sydney Thunder [getting bowled out for 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnbpGKnnowo) against the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash. Before the two teams face off again tonight at the Adelaide Oval, let’s take a closer look at some of the biggest collapses in BBL history. 

For the purposes of this post, a collapse is defined as a team losing all ten wickets over the course of the game. 

It’s no surprise that the Thunder’s measly 15 runs is the biggest collapse in BBL history, going from 0/2 to 10/15 in just 5.2 overs. It’s a far cry from the Heat losing 10/36 and the Renegades losing 10/44, as can be seen in the figure below.

Making things worse for the Thunder is the fact that their second-biggest collapse (59 runs) is still bigger than this biggest collapse experienced by the Sixers (60 runs), Strikers (62 runs), and Hurricanes (81 runs).

But it’s worse news for Renegades fans, who have three of the ten biggest collapses in BBL history – with two of those occurring in the same season. I’ll also point out that the Stars have two of the ten biggest collapses, which also occurred in the same season, in the interest of fairness.
