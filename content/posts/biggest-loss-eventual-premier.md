On [Episode 2 of the *Useless AFL Stats* podcast](https://uselessaflstats.buzzsprout.com/2211261/13187700-2-seriously-useless-stats), special guest Chris Coleman (sports broadcaster and host of the *[Super Serious Sports Show](https://www.mix106.com.au/shows/super-serious-sports-show/)* and the boys were talking about the biggest loss by a team that went on to win the flag. This record is held by Carlton, who won the flag in 1945 after [losing by 100 points to Essendon in Round 3](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1945/030519450505.html). 

Following on from this discussion, Chris asked stats guru Liam Crowhurst what the smallest largest loss an eventual premier had in a season. [Like last week](https://www.lincolntracy.com/posts/rushed-behinds/), I thought I would have a go at finding the answer. 

As far as I can tell, the smallest largest loss by an eventual premier is **5 points**. This happened in [Round 4, 1918, when South Melbourne lost to St Kilda](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1918/151619180603.html). This was their only loss for the season.

So, I sent in my findings once again, and I got a pleasant surprise when I sat and listened to [Episode 3](https://uselessaflstats.buzzsprout.com/2211261/13236789-3-carlton-and-port-grand-final), where Liam reverted to his high school days and copied his answer from one of his friends who had done the homework – me! I’m a little touched that I’m a friend in this scenario. *The homework section of the podcast starts at the 10 minute mark, for anyone interested.*

But my mind was blown even further by the special guest on Episode 3 – podcaster, AFL history buff, and Essendon supporter Tim from the [*Kick to Kick* podcast](https://kicktokick.podbean.com/) – who shared this interesting tidbit about that 1918 game:

> “South Melbourne had a very good team, and they were invited up to the Dandenong Ranges by one of their sponsors and had quite a big night the night before [the game]. They were late to the game and rocked up a little bit tipsy and hungover, and that’s how St Kilda were able to beat them in that one game.”

> “The next year when they played St Kilda for the first time, they were really angry about it. And I think you’ll see the highest quarter score ever is that game where I think they kicked 19 goals in the last quarter – they absolutely demolished St Kilda as a bit of revenge for the year before when they ruined their perfect record.”

I looked into this claim, and Tim was pretty close. While South Melbourne did get their revenge against St Kilda in their first meeting of 1919 (Round 3), they only [won by 36 points](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1919/151619190517.html). However, when the two teams played later that year in Round 12, [South Melbourne won by 171 points after kicking 17.4 to 0.0 in the final quarter](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1919/151619190726.html). 

**Some other fun stats from my research:**

The second smallest largest loss by an eventual premier is also by a team that only lost one game of the season, when the [Bulldogs defeated Essendon by 11 points in Round 21, 2000](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2000/050720000728.html). 

The smallest largest loss by an eventual premier who lost more than one game in a season is 12 points, which has happened on three occasions: most recently in 1932 when Richmond won the flag after losing to Carlton by 1 point in Round 3, drawing with Geelong in Round 6, losing to South Melbourne by 2 points in Round 8, and losing to Collingwood by 12 points in Round 10. This also happened in 1911 and 1927.

*Thanks again to the UAS team for the question and for letting me crash Liam's homework segment. Keep up the great work!*
