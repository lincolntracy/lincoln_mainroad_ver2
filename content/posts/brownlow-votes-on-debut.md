*Talk about starting your career with a bang*

<!--more-->

A total of 3,551 players made their VFL/AFL debut during the home and away season between 1984 and 2022. **Only 45 of them polled Brownlow votes in their first game**, which is a little more than one percent of all players. Of these 45, **15 received one vote**, **20 received two votes**, and **10 received three votes**. A list of each player who polled Brownlow votes on debut can be seen below.

Three players who polled Brownlow votes went on to win the Brownlow at some point in their career: Brad Hardie in 1985, John Platten in 1987, and Greg Williams in 1986 and 1994. I find it quite interesting that this happened three years in a row. However, it’s important to note that Errol Gulden, Clayton Oliver, and Izak Rankine could be added to this list if they win one during the remainder of their careers.

But not everyone who polls Brownlow votes in their first game goes on to have success for the rest of their careers. **Twelve** of the 45 players who polled on debut never polled again, although only one of these ended up playing more than 50 games, as seen in the table below.

*% = percentage of Brownlow votes earned on debut relative to career total. Note: Games played and career Brownlow votes correct to the end of the 2022 season.*

There seems to be a clear pattern between the number of Brownlow votes received on debut and the number disposals earned, marks taken, and goals kicked, as indicated by the table below.

*D = disposals, M = marks, G = goals, T = tackles. Note: Tackles were recorded from 1985 onwards*

Let’s use the data in the table above to wildly speculate if any of the 70 players who made their debut in the 2023 home and away season have a chance at getting votes. This is wild speculation, as we aren’t considering how well the debutants performed relative to other players in their team, are only looking at a small amount of the available data, and are not considering how the game has changed between 1985 and 2023.

Based on this, I suspect **Harry Sheezel** will poll at least one vote for his [34-disposal, nine-mark game in North’s five-point win](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2023/121820230318.html) over West Coast in Round 1. This might not be too wild of a guess, given he won the Rising Star Award and North Melbourne's Best and Fairest. 

Other potential guesses where a debutant could poll votes, using the same logic as above:
- Alex Cincotta (24 disposals, seven marks – [Round 6 v St Kilda](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2023/031520230423.html))
- Jacob van Rooyen (nine disposals, three marks, three goals, and six tackles – [Round 3 v Sydney](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2023/111620230402.html))
