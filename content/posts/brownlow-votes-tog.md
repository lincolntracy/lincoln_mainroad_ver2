*Which players have made the best of their limited opportunities?*

<!--more-->

Adam Cerra was [“arguably the best on ground across the first half”](https://www.afl.com.au/afl/matches/4948#match-report) in Carlton’s 17-point win over Collingwood in Round 20, collecting 20 disposals (nine contested; 65% efficiency), six clearances, five inside 50s, 466 meters gained, and two tackles before being subbed off shortly after half time with a hamstring concern. He only spent 40% of the game on the ground. 

After the game, some of my friends were talking about who was best on ground, as one of them has their own Brownlow vote tracker. This led to a debate about whether Cerra could possibly steal a vote despite being missing much of the second half due to injury, which in turn led to one of them asking about the smallest time on ground percentage to earn a vote.

That record is held by former Collingwood ruckman **[Guy Richards](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/G/Guy_Richards.html)**, who played 39 games for the Pies between 2004 and 2007. Richards earned a single Brownlow vote for his [six-disposal, 13-hit-out contribution on 42% game time](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2006/041020060409.html) in Collingwood’s 35-point in over Hawthorn in Round 2, 2006. Anthony Rocca collected three votes after kicking eight goals, while Ben Johnson scored two votes after 31 disposals and a goal.

*K = kicks, H = handballs, M = marks, G = goals, B - behinds, HO = hit outs, T = tackles, C = clearances, i50 = inside 50s, BV = Brownlow votes, TOG = % time on ground*

Former St Kilda, Hawthorn, and Sydney ruckman Peter “Spida” Everitt holds the record for the smallest time on ground percentage to earn three Brownlow votes (52%) when [Sydney defeated Richmond by 16 points in Round 2, 2007](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2007/141620070407.html). 

I feel Cerra is a chance to steal a vote on Brownlow night, but I say that with full acknowledgement of my Carlton supporter bias. Who do you think could be a surprise vote getter, in terms of smallest time on ground percentage?
