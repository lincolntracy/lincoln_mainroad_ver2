The AFL world was sent into a frenzy last Friday night, with Lance “Buddy” Franklin becoming just the sixth man—after Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Gary Ablett Senior, Jason Dunstall, and Tony Lockett—to kick 1000 goals over their career. 

But Franklin and the Swans came back to earth with a bump last night, going down to the Western Bulldogs by 11 points at Marvel Stadium. The Bulldogs should have won by a more convincing margin, kicking 9.17 from 49 inside 50s.

With the loss, Franklin joins Doug Wade as the only players to lose their first game *after* kicking their thousandth goal. Wade kicked three goals in the 1974 semi-final as his Kangaroos lost to Richmond by 21 points.

The table below shows the performances in the game after their thousandth goal was kicked. Individual stats are not available for Gordon Coventry, as these were not recorded at the time.

Swans coach John Longmire was uncertain if his team’s poor showing was the result of an emotional “hangover” after the celebrations of last week.

Injured Swans ruck Sam Naismith had a different view on the result, with the Swans receiving 14 free kicks to the Bulldogs’ 31.

Either way, Franklin and Wade are now part of a very exclusive club that may never get another member.
