It’s hard to argue that the Bulldogs haven’t had issues with goal kicking in the past few weeks.

The issue first appeared in their 12-point loss to Carlton in Round 2 (13.12), where they missed several gettable shots in the final quarter that would have completed a come-from-behind victory.

It continued in their 11-point victory against the Swans in Round 3, which ultimately should have been by a more significant margin. The Bulldogs kicked 9.17 (five rushed behinds) in their first win of the season.

It then cost them again last week against Richmond, kicking 7.19 in a 38-point loss. And it’s not their only issue, with *AFL.com* reporting they have [issues all over the ground](https://www.afl.com.au/news/740984/goalkicking-just-the-start-of-misfiring-dogs-to-do-list).

But things aren’t as bad as it could be, for the Bulldogs. Over the last three weeks, just 37.85% of Bulldogs scores have been goals. This is the 99th lowest average over a three-week period in the history of the club.

The worst three-week goalkicking performance came in Rounds 4, 5, and 6 in 1949, when they kicked 4.15, 6.14, and 10.22 in successive weeks. That comes in at 27.43% of scores as goals.

That’s quite a respectable percentage, compared to other teams. As we can see in the table below, St Kilda once had only 4.17% of scores as goals in a three-week period back in 1897.

However, the Bulldogs have a perfect opportunity this week to get over their goalkicking issues. Will there be a repeat of last year’s Good Friday blowout against North Melbourne, where they kicked 25.17 on their way to a 128-point win?
