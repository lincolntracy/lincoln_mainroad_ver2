*Three Bulldogs brought their own ball to yesterday's game*

<!--more-->

Yesterday I noticed that the three top disposal getters for the Bulldogs in their win over Fremantle (Bailey Dale, Lachlan Bramble, and Marcus Bontempelli) all registered 30 disposals. 

It got me wondering whether this was some kind of record, as there aren’t too many games I can remember where a team was so top-heavy in terms of their leading disposal getters.

Turns out this was the **seventh time** the top three ball getters on the same team all had 30 disposals, but it was the first time since 2021:

However, as can be seen from the image above it was well short in terms of the record for when three players from the same team finished on the same number of disposals.

That record belongs to Carlton’s **Sam Kerridge, Marc Murphy, and Kade Simpson**, who each racked up 35 disposals in their [eight-point loss to Melbourne](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2017/031120170709.html) in Round 16, 2017.

Special mention has to go to Geelong’s Jimmy Bartel, Steve Johnson, Joel Selwood, and Mathew Stokes, who all had [31 disposals](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/2013/091920130623.html) in the ‘[Miracle on Grass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYxcTH19jTk)’ loss to the Brisbane Lions. 

The record for the highest number of disposals recorded by five players in the same team is 28, when Peter Bourke, Scott Clayton, Wally Matera, Brendan McCormack, and Brett Stephens all collected 28 disposals in [Fitzroy’s six-point win over St Kilda](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1989/061519890715.html) in Round 15, 1989.
