On 2 August 2022, JAMA (the Journal of the American Medical Association) published the article, [“Effect of Graded Sensorimotor Retraining on Pain Intensity in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial.”](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2794765) This trial, which included 276 participants, sought to estimate the effect of a sensorimotor retraining intervention (RESOLVE) on pain intensity in people with chronic low back pain. In this podcast, several of this study’s researchers speak with PRF contributor, Lincoln Tracy, PhD, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. They discuss the trial’s design and setting, its main findings, and the future research resulting from this work.
