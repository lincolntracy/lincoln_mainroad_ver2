The prevalence, incidence, and mortality of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been reported to have distinct geographical and temporal patterns. Specifically, increasing latitude towards the poles is associated with increased prevalence. Scientists have considered latitude as a surrogate for environmental factors, such as UV exposure, given previous studies report a link between lower UV exposure and an increased risk of MS. An important limitation of previous studies has been the neglect of an individualâ€™s long-term migration history, resulting in a failure to acknowledge the exposures accumulated over a lifetime.
