There has been a lot of talk about win streaks this year, with multiple teams having impressive stretches of successive wins. Port Adelaide won 13 in a row, GWS won seven in a row, and Carlton have currently won nine in a row (including yesterday’s victory over the Gold Coast). On the back of this, one of my friends asked about how teams that had won eight or more games in a row during the home and away season had gone in the context of the overall season, and in their words, “whether the norm is [making] the grand final”.

Let’s find out.

There have been **165 occasions** where a team has had eight or more consecutive wins during the home and away season since the inception of the V/AFL, including Carlton, Collingwood, and Port Adelaide this season. A full list of these occasions, and how the team went that year (i.e., whether they won the flag, etc.) can be found [here](/files/content/posts/eight-plus-win-streak/eight-plus-win-streak-list.pdf). 

Some rapid-fire stats from the whole list:
- Collingwood had two separate streaks of winning eight or more games in the 1970 season
- Sixty-four of the 161 teams to win eight- or more game in a row (39.8%) were premiers that year
- Only six of the 161 teams with an eight- or more-game win streak failed to make finals
- The Brisbane Bears and University never had an eight-game win streak during their existence, while Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney are yet to experience an eight-game win streak 

It’s somewhat challenging to make fair comparisons over how an eight-game win streak during the regular season translates to finals success given the V/AFL has used [12 different finals systems during their history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL_finals_series#Systems). So, to try and make things “fair”, or “consistent”, I’ll focus on data from 2000 onwards, which uses the [AFL final eight system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL_final_eight_system).

Since 2000 (and including 2023), there have been 45 occasions where a team has won eight or more consecutive games. Prior to this year, every team on this list played finals. The average ladder position for these teams was 2.5, with 17 of these 45 teams finishing on top. This is the most common final ladder position for a team with an eight- or more-game win streak. Interestingly, a team has never won eight or more games in a row and finished seventh.

But onto the important stuff. The table below breaks down the outcome for the 42 teams with completed seasons.

**Table: Season outcomes for teams with eight-plus game win streaks, 2000-2022**

| Outcome           | Frequency |
| :---------------: | :-------: |
| Elimination Final | 3         |
| Semi Final        | 5         |
| Preliminary Final | 14        |
| Grand Finalist    | 6         |
| Premier           | 14        |

So, it turns out teams with eight-plus game win streaks during the regular season either fall at the preliminary final stage or go on to win the whole thing. I’ll be ecstatic if Carlton make a prelim (or the grand final), but I think Collingwood or Port Adelaide making it to the later stages of September are more likely (especially when you consider ladder position, see below). **No team with an eight-plus game win streak that finishes outside the top four has made it to the grand final, let alone won it.**
