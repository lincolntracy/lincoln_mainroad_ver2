*A rookie, a former number one overall pick, and the MVP favourite, that’s who*

<!--more-->

Towards the end of last year I saw a tweet listing the NFL quarterbacks who had thrown five or more touchdowns this season. The list had two names:
- [C.J. Stroud](https://www.houstontexans.com/news/c-j-stroud-leads-comeback-drive-throws-5-tds-in-historic-win-vs-tampa-bay) (Houston Texans)
- [Jared Goff](https://www.espn.com.au/nfl/story/_/id/39130643/jared-goff-tosses-5-tds-bounce-back-game-lions) (Detroit Lions)

I think this stat generated a lot of interest because of the names on the list. 

Stroud is a rookie (the Texans selected with the second overall pick of the 2023 draft) who came into the league with doubts as to [whether he could excel outside of collegiate schemes and systems](https://www.nfl.com/prospects/c.j.-stroud/32005354-5270-2090-cc17-67cd6da43535#:~:text=The%20question%20now%20is%20how%20quickly%20he%20will%20acclimate%20outside%20of%20the%20Ohio%20State%20scheme.). He has set [several records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._J._Stroud#Records_and_achievements) in his debut season despite these doubts. 

Goff, an eight-season veteran of the league, has had an [up-and-down career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff#Professional_career) after being selected as the #1 overall pick by the then St. Lois Rams. He was sent to Detroit as part of the Matthew Stafford trade after the 2020 season and was a key contributor to the Lions winning their first NFC North title. 

Since this tweet was posted only one name has been added to the list: [Lamar Jackson](https://www.nfl.com/games/dolphins-at-ravens-2023-reg-17?active-tab=stats).

Jackson went 18/21 for 321 yards in Week 17 when the Ravens trounced the Dolphins 56-19. He is currently the wild favourite to be named MVP. 

But how does this list of two QBs compare to other years?

While this season’s three is a step up from last season’s two (Patrick Mahomes in Week 1 and 	
Tua Tagovailoa in Week 2), it’s a far cry from the 11 occurrences in 2004 (Daunte Culpepper [x3], Donovan McNabb, Drew Brees, Kelly Holcomb, Kerry Collins, and Peyton Manning [x4]) and 2015 (Aaron Rodgers, Blake Bortles, Cam Newton [x3], Drew Brees, Eli Manning, Jameis Winston, Matthew Stafford, and Russell Wilson [x2]).
