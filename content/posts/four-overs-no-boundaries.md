*One player stands alone at the peak*

While the Melbourne Stars (deservedly) received a lot of attention after [winning the New Year’s Eve game against the Adelaide Strikers](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/big-bash-league-2023-24-1386092/adelaide-strikers-vs-melbourne-stars-20th-match-1386113/match-report), something else amazing happened.

Cameron Boyce had his **twelfth** game where he bowled his for overs without conceding a boundary, a BBL record.

Boyce took 1/15 off his allotted overs, with nine dot balls. He was the only Strikers bowlers to keep his economy in single figures. 

It was the second time this season Boyce has achieved this feat, after collecting [0/25 against the Sixers last month](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/big-bash-league-2023-24-1386092/sydney-sixers-vs-adelaide-strikers-11th-match-1386104/full-scorecard). 

Nine of the 12 occasions happened while Boyce was playing for the Renegades, with the remaining occasion occurring while playing for the Hurricanes.
