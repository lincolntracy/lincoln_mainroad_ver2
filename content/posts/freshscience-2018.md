In 2018 I was invited to participate in the Victorian leg of [Fresh Science](http://freshscience.org.au/), a national competition helping early-career researchers find, and then share, their stories of discovery. This involved spending two days in at the [Royal Society of Victoria](https://rsv.org.au/) where I received media and communication training from TV, radio, and print journalists including Jay Mueller from [Bad Producer Productions](https://badproducerproductions.com/), and Misha Ketchell from [The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/au).

You can read more about my research, and research from the other Victorian Fresh Science participants [here](http://freshscience.org.au/category/state/vic).
