*Are AFL players still getting better all the time?*

<!--more-->

Back in 2021 I made a blog post, [Getting Better](https://www.lincolntracy.com/posts/getting-better/), where I looked at how many weeks in a row a player performed better – or recorded an increase in a particular statistic compared to their previous game. 

As we get closer to the start of the 2024 AFL season, let’s take another look at the data to see if there have been any changes to the record holders since the initial post.

### Kicks
**Previous record holder:** [Daniel Rioli (seven games)](https://www.lincolntracy.com/posts/getting-better/#:~:text=come%20up%20with.-,Kicks,-First%20cab%20of)

**Current active streak:** Lachlan Keeffe, Darcy Fort, Dante Visentini, Sam Darcy (two games)

### Bounces

**Changes to the record:** None

**Current active streak:** Xavier O’Neill, Logan McDonald (four games)

*I’m a little surprised by there only being three players who have tied existing streaks, and that no players took a record outright. But I suppose this speaks to the unique set of circumstances that need to occur for something like this to happen.*
