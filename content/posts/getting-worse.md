*What goes up must come down*

<!--more-->

I’ve previously written two posts about the idea of AFL players getting better, or looking at the number of consecutive weeks they recorded an increase in a particular statistic compared to their previous game. The [original post](https://www.lincolntracy.com/posts/getting-better/) was published back in 2021, before I published an updated version [earlier this year](https://www.lincolntracy.com/posts/getting-better-redux/).

But what if we look at the opposite, at players who performed worse each week? How do the streaks compare, and have there been any players who have had an extremely hot and cold streak throughout their career?
