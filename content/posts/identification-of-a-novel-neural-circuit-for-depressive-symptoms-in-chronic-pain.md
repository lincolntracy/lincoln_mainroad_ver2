There are suggestions that the dysfunction of the brainâ€™s serotonin system is related to both pain and depression. However, we lack a good understanding of how chronic pain may affect the functioning of the serotonin system and how this, in turn, might impact depressive symptoms. Previous evidence suggests that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a likely convergence point between chronic pain and depression.
