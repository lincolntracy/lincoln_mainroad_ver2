*Tomorrow's Grand Final will be the first time Sydney have played at the 'G in five months.*

<!--more-->

Last night on Channel 7’s *The Front Bar* Mick Molloy and current Carlton coach Michael Voss discussed Brisbane’s run of form leading into the 2024 AFL Grand Final.

> Voss: “They’ve got another mountain to climb, though, to be able to come down to the MCG and play interstate for the third time is difficult in itself. But they’re certainly up for it, they would certainly be a confident side right now.”

> Molloy: “Can I say, how big of an advantage is to have actually played on the MCG the week before and beaten a Melbourne team in front of 90,000 people? Sydney haven’t played on the ‘G for a while – can you underestimate the value of having chalked up a win there the week before the Grand Final?”

> Voss: “It’s huge, especially when you’re talking about playing in front of the crowd that you had to play in front of and being familiar with the ground. There’s one disadvantage about flying home and then coming back, but I think the benefit outweighs anything that goes against them.”

To say that the Swans haven’t played at the MCG for a while is an understatement.
