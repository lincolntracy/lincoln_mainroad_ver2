I’m a Levi Casboult fan. So, it goes without saying I was disappointed when Carlton delisted Casboult after the 2021 season. I can’t deny he didn’t have his shortcomings, but he had a great pair of hands and was a [booming kick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T4m9kfwKyU).

After he was selected by Carlton in the third round of the 2010 Rookie Draft, he became only the second Levi in AFL history behind former Kangaroo and Magpie [Levi Greenwood](https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/L/Levi_Greenwood.html). Greenwood retired during the 2021 season due to ongoing issues with concussion.

Let’s compare the pair over the course of their careers, stats wise.

The differences are largely what you would come to expect, given Casboult played as a forward/ruck while Greenwood was a midfielder. One thing that caught my eye was Casboult’s one career bounce, which came in Round 18, 2015, against North Melbourne.

Casboult is one of 183 players in AFL history with only one career bounce. Other players in the one bounce club include Shaun Rehn, Ryan Fitzgerald, Mark Jamar, Robert Warnock, Shane Mumford, Tom Bellchambers, Liam Jones, and Caleb Serong. 

However, Casboult was given a chance to continue his AFL career with the Gold Coast Suns, who [selected him with pick #3 of the Rookie Draft in late November](https://www.afl.com.au/news/689584/cut-carlton-big-man-heads-north-port-hands-lifeline-to-delisted-roo). 

He now can add to some of the stats in the table above. Playing seven or more games is a possibility, meaning he would take the games played record for a Levi off Greenwood. Personally, I’m just hoping for more double cobras.
