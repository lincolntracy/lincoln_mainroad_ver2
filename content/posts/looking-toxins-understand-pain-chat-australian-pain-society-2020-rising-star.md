Samuel Robinson, PhD, is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Australia. He completed his PhD with Raymond Norton at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, and returned to Australia in 2017 after finishing a postdoc with Baldomero “Toto” Olivera at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, US. Robinson recently won the Australian Pain Society’s Rising Star Award for 2020, which showcases up-and-coming pain researchers in Australia. Like many academic conferences, the 2020 Australian Pain Society 40th Annual Scientific Meeting, where Rising Star Award winners give a plenary presentation to showcase their work, was unable to proceed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Robinson recently spoke with Lincoln Tracy, a research fellow at Monash University, via Zoom. Robinson discussed his journey to pain research, his work on new plant and animal toxins that can be used to identify novel pain targets, what winning the Rising Star Award means to him, and much more.
