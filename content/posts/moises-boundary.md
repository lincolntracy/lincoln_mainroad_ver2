*An interesting stat about Australia’s [most infamous Spotify user](https://www.triplem.com.au/story/moises-henriques-has-addressed-the-time-he-got-caught-listening-to-some-spotify-123761)*

<!--more-->

I was watching the Sixers play the Strikers in the Big Bash last week while I was visiting my parents, and Michael Vaughn made an interesting comment when [Moises Henriques was dismissed for 20 off 24 balls after failing to hit a four or a six:](https://www.cricket.com.au/matches/CA:17702/sydney-sixers-men-adelaide-strikers-men-kfc-bbl-13?tab=scorecard&replayid=6343720393112)

>  “It’s not often you see Moises Henriques bat and face 24 balls in the Big Bash without a boundary".

Let’s see how much truth there is to Vaughn’s comment.

Henriques has played [123 BBL matches](https://www.cricket.com.au/players/CA:912?tab=statistics) for the Sydney Sixers and batted in 117 innings. He has faced 24 or more balls 40 times (34% all innings) and failed to hit a boundary **on just of these two occasions**.

So, it looks like Vaughn was on the money with his comment.

But the thing I find really interesting is that Henriques **faced 24 balls and didn’t hit a boundary for two games in a row** – he scored another 20 off 24 balls in the [previous game against the Hurricanes](https://www.cricket.com.au/matches/CA:17692/hobart-hurricanes-men-sydney-sixers-men-kfc-bbl-13?tab=scorecard). It will be interesting to see if this happens for the third time in a row when the Sixers face off against the Thunder later tonight. 

Another interesting point is the fact that Henriques is part of a sextet of players in BBL history to have at least 40 innings of 24 or more balls. But he and Jonathon Wells are the **only two to not have a perfect strike rate** with respect to hitting a boundary while batting during these innings.
