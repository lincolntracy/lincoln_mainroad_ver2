Much of our knowledge about activity in the brain has been obtained from studies of “task-evoked activations”—or looking at how groups of neurons respond to external events (such as lights or sounds) or experimental conditions. These types of studies have predominantly used functional neuroimaging to examine activity between different areas of the brain. However, due to the limitations surrounding the temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of neuroimaging data, it is challenging to draw conclusions about the profiles and relevance of neuronal activity at the population level.
