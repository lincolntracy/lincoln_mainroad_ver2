[Pain Research Forum](https://www.painresearchforum.org/), 18 July 2018

Liesbet Goubert, PhD, is a professor in the Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology at Ghent University, Belgium. Her PhD research examined the role of psychosocial risk factors for the development of low back pain, but she has since shifted her focus to interpersonal dynamics of pain and chronic illness. Goubert is particularly interested in the study of psychosocial resilience mechanisms that may underlie adaptive functioning and well-being in the presence of pain. Goubert recently sat down to speak with Lincoln Tracy, a research fellow from Monash University, Australia, at the 2018 Australian Pain Society 38th and New Zealand Pain Society Conjoint Annual Scientific Meeting, which took place April 8-11 in Sydney, Australia. Goubert discussed her research journey, her own experience living with chronic pain, and much more.
