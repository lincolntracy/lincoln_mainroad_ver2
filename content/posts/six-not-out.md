*The Oil Rig joins a very exclusive group in BBL history*

<!--more-->

Last night the Melbourne Stars won their third game in a row thanks to some [incredible batting from Beau Webster (66* off 48), Marcus Stoinis (55* off 19), and Dan Lawrence (50 off 26)](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/big-bash-league-2023-24-1386092/adelaide-strikers-vs-melbourne-stars-20th-match-1386113/match-report).

The match ended with Stoinis hitting James Bazley for six off the last ball of the nineteenth over.

It was the **119th time** a BBL innings ended with a six off the final ball of the innings, and the fifth time Stoinis has achieved this feat.

Stoinis drew level with his captain, Glenn Maxwell, as the only two players in BBL history to hit a six off the last ball of the innings **five times**.

Stonis’ effort moves the Stars into outright second from a team perspective, trailing only the Perth Scorchers.
