I went to the Carlton v Melbourne game last night with some friends. After the game we were having a drink in a bar and watching the end of the Derby, where Freo belted the Eagles by 101 points. The conversation turned to whether there had ever been such a large margin in a previous Derby, or any of the other state-based rivalry games. We thought there might have been some games that had similar scores (particularly when Gold Coast and GWS entered the league) but couldn’t remember any specific games.

So, I went and did some digging, and here are the top five margins in the history of the Derby, the Showdown, the QClash (aka Mango Tangle, Pineapple Grapple), and the Battle of the Bridge.
